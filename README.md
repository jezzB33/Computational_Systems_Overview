# Computational Systems Overview

This repository serves as an introduction and guide to the interconnected fields of computational systems. Our focus spans across various topics including Language Design, Compiler Development, Parser Generators, Static Analysis, Programming Analysis, SAT Solver Systems, Applications of SAT Systems, and Problem Modelling and Solution Interpretation Tools.

## High-level Overview of the Field

Computational systems is a vast field with numerous interconnected domains. It covers everything from the design of programming languages, to the development of compilers that translate these languages into machine code, to the creation and application of SAT solvers that can be used to solve complex problems. Each of these areas, while being a deep field of study in its own right, often relies heavily on concepts and tools from the others.
